This is a demo app coded in 10 minutes during the August 28 Boston Python
meetup, as part of my presentation on
[flask-chassis](https://github.com/SawdustSoftware/flask-chassis).

This takes the [backbone.js example todo
app](backbonejs.org/examples/todos/index.html) and builds a quick and dirty
flask backend for it, using chassis as a starting point.

This is an example to show you how quickly you can get up and running with
flask and chassis, and the code is exactly what I coded up live, unedited. It
is decidedly NOT a paragon of best practices to follow in production code,
although it's not terrible either.

You can see the [slides](http://akmanalp.com/chassis_presentation/) and the
[video of the
presentation](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br4NLY2rGs0&list=UUZaXkyk7MOwF-25_VAdnfnQ&feature=player_detailpage#t=3211).

The juicy bits of the code are in `src/chassis/`, especially views.py,
models.py, factories.py.
